-----

**XAnoS** stands for **X**-ray **Ano**malous **S**cattering. This package provides collection of python widgets developed at NSF's ChemMatCARS, 15IDD, Advanced Photon Source, for measuring and analyzing Anomalous Small Angle X-ray Scattering (ASAXS) data.

The documentation of **XAnoS** is under rapid development and available at: https://nayanbera.github.io/XAnoS/
